## Usage

The UPM of this typeface is 1200, so the font should be scaled an integer multiple of a size of 12px for the best result.

For better display result, the OpenType kern for this typeface does not take an integer multiple of the cell size (default is 100). This may cause the font wrong render results under some circumstances. Please turn off any anti-aliasing settings or filtering modes, and set the tracking to 0 when it’s possible.
